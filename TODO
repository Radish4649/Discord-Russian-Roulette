1. make killed players unable to continue shooting until a new game has started
    this is likely best accomplished by putting their names in the game_object file

2. create !!kickstart that kicks players upon losing
    this will likely require refactoring some existing commands

3. refactor existing code
    it's kind of ugly tbh lol

4. transfer existing game_object system to sql or something
    I need sql practice anyway so might as well do it here? idk REST is hard though.
